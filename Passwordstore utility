1) Install pass utility
    sudo apt-get install pass / yum install pass
3) Inorder for pass utility to work, we need to have gpg key
    a) Generate gpg key
        gpg --gen-key
        (Option 1, 0, y, <Give remaining fields accordingly)
    b) Verify keys are generated
        gpg --list-keys
4) Initialize pass utility
        pass init <gpg ID>
5) Trust the key
        gpg --edit-key <keyID>, trust, 5, save
6) Insert key into the store
        pass insert <keyName>
    Note :- Incase you need to have this stored in separate directories, "pass insert <dir>/<keyName>
7) List down keys
    pass/pass <keyName>
    
 
 Note: If nothing is working. Delete all keys (keys and secret keys) and remove ~/.gnupg directory.
 And generate keys. It should work.
